# First post

Hello, this is my first post about learning fastai, and how to do deep learning in Python.

During my bachelor's degree, I gained experience in deep learning, specifically working on a project involving weed detection using RCNN.  Although my experience was on a different platform, I'm now able to learn fastai and deep learning in Python.

After watching all the part 1 videos, I have noticed that the lessons are detailed and cover a good amount of examples.  While I am probably still not able to digest all the content in part 1, I still appreciate the learning experience in the Python platform for deep learning.

Lesson 8, which focuses on CNNs, has captured my attention due to some RCNN experience.  Despite I was successfully completing my project, I'm still not quite sure if I understand the concept of CNN correctly or not.  Again, this opportunity to learn about CNNs is incredibly valuable for strengthening my understanding of fundamental principles underlying deep learning.
