# Second post
This is my second post about deep learning. 

I have watched several tutorial videos in part 2. Although it is not really directly teaching how to approach the assignment 3 questions, it is still helpful to learn some ideas of how deep learning works. 

Also, as I already tried a few days, I still cannot correctly set up my Python environment on my local computer properly, and considering that the Codespace is often disconnected during the training, I am now changing the platform to Google Colab. I found out it is way easier than using Codespace. There is no disconnection throughout the whole training time. Therefore, I recommend that Brain not use the Codespace from GitHub anymore and let future students work on Google Colab directly. 

Moreover, I hope Brain can let the teaching team know the assignment question before the assignment starts. I agree that all the tutors are trying to be helpful, but knowing the problem forehead is necessary for tutors to prepare for it.
